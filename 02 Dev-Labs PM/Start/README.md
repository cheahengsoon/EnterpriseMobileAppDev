## Dev Days HOL

Xamarin Dev Days provide attendees with an intense, hands-on learning experience. Spend the morning exploring mobile development with sessions from Xamarin, our technology partners, and members of your local developer community, then roll up your sleeves for an afternoon dedicated to diving into code.

Each Xamarin Dev Days is unique, but youâ€™ll always walk away with a better understanding of how you can build, test, and monitor native iOS, Android, and Windows apps with Xamarin.

Inside this repo you will find all of the presentations, demos, and hands on labs that you will experience at Xamarin Dev Days!
